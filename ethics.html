<p>According to the Programming Code of Ethics on <a id = "links" href="http://www.gammadyne.com/ethics.htm">gammadyne.com</a>, the first bullet point states that "A programmer must never create or distribute malware".
</p>
<p>If this code of ethics were not followed by the programmer, there will be many consequences.</p>
<p>The most obvious consequence would be legal consequences. Creating and distributing malware is a crime, as it infiltrates other people's personal property and information. The malware can be used to do anything, such as spying, stealing and destroying personal information.
The programmer would definitely face legal charges and even jail time if caught. Having a record of crime is detrimental to the programmer's career, as all future employers will know he/she has committed a serious offence.
