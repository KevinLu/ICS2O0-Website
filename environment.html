The Mass Extinction Event may likely be the end of the Anthropocene Epoch, or the age of humans. Because of human activity such as overexploitation, habitat destruction and industrial manufacturing, global warming has been on the horizon ever since.
</p>
<p>We must prepare and prevent/delay this extinction event from happening, and the only way is to stop these destructive practices immediately. As an individual, there is not much I can do to delay the event since every human on Earth is required to take part in it.
The most I can do as an individual is to recycle, reduce my carbon footprint and plant trees. All of these activities reduce the stress I put on the environment, ultimately benefitting everyone else that share the planet with me.</p>
<p>If everyone on Earth did the same activities I'm doing to delay the extinction event from happening, it is possible that we won't experience the effects of it for another few centuries.
