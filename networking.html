<p>Being transported back 100 years would land me in the year 1917. Without any electronic devices, I must adapt to the new lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
First, it is crucial that I must drop the habit of using a search engine for instant information. To solve this issue, I can visit the library and obtain information from encylopedias, which will not only increase my knowledge of the time period but will also
force me to obtain information the "old fashioned" way. Communication would also be a problem, as letters take days to arrive and the telephone is still a relatively new technology. I will try to send more letters to get a sense of long how it takes to arrive to the destination.</p>
<p>Money would also be different, as the prices of goods would drastically change and there are no debit/credit cards to use to pay. Everything would be paid in coins and bills.
In the end, it is not difficult to adjust to a lifestyle without electronic devices since one must drop the habit of instant information and be used to the old methods of communications.
