</p>
<p>Using SDLC and flowcharts, students map out how their program will function. Since they are only required to create animations in Processing, many feel there is no use for a flowchart as their program is very basic and only has one function and no inputs.</p>
<p>Personally, I did not use a flowchart for any of my Processing programs because they are very basic in function. However, if I were to be asked to create a more complicated program, such as one with inputs and decisions, a flowchart would definitely be helpful.
