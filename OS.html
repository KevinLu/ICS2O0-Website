The world is left with many distributions of Linux to choose from, with the most popular options being Ubuntu, Arch Linux and CentOS.
However, with some knowledge in Linux acquired from the computer studies course, I choose to use Elementary OS.
</p>
<p>According to Elementary's official website, elementary.io, it is a fast and open replacement for Windows and macOS. Since this is the case, it would make the transition into the distribution much easier, and would take less time to
learn the Linux system.
Another benefit of Elementary OS is that it is open source, this means that anyone can look at the code to review, modify and use. It also makes sure that there are no hidden strings attached to the product, such as spyware and adware.</p>
<p>The creators of Elementary OS believe in lightweight software, therefore they only include a handful of necessary apps catered to everyday needs. Users can then download more apps from the Open Source App Store as needed.
In conclusion, Elementary OS is the clear choice for an operating system if Windows and MacOS are not available as it is secure, open source and built with accessibility in mind.
