<p>Throughout the course of the semester, I have learned a lot about computers, as it is the main focus of the course.
From having no knowledge of Processing and HTML at the beginning of the course to some extent of knowledge at the end, it is evident that the ICS2O course teaches computer knowledge at a fast paced and understandable level.
I will definitely be creating another computer program in my life, as I plan on taking the Grade 11 Computer Science course. The Grade 11 course will further improve my understanding of the computer as well as teach me the advanced aspects of programming.
Since computers interest me, taking computer studies in a post secondary environment would be very interesting because it could be a great career path in the future. With the knowledge acquired in post secondary and the foundation in high school, I am confident
that creating a computer program would be a daily task for me.</p>
