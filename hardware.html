Hardware knowledge is essential to a computer programmer because of many reasons, most notably compatibility, size and efficiency.
When developing a computer program, the programmer must make sure the program can run on the intended platforms he/she is developing for.
For example, a computer programmer should know whether the program will work on an older CPU architecture, especially when developing on a modern computer.
Some programs may not work because it is too new for older computers, and it is the programmer's job to make the program available to as many computers as possible.
The same principal applies to size. If a computer program takes up too much space on a hard drive, chances are very little customers would want to use it. This is because
it will take a long time to download, if it is hosted on the web, or there is simply not enough space for the customer to install it. It can also be a problem on older computers, where
storage is limited. Finally, efficiency plays a role in the development of a computer program. If the programmer has knowledge in hardware, he/she can fix any errors occuring due to hardware faster.
Errors like this are bound to happen in the software development cycle, therefore the faster the programmer is able to fix such problems, the faster the program will be finished.</p>
